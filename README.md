## Color Scheme

The Main Color Scheme that was chosen for this website was based on the typical color that would come to mind if one was to think of Africa or Safari. When designing the website, the main color #724A1B and #47583E came to mind. I used the website [Coolor](https://coolors.co/) to generate the complementary colors that will fit hand-in-hand with the main colors that was chosen.
